Commit: ${COMMIT_INFO}

Changed files:
${file_list}

Instructions:
1. Run \`$DIFF_CMD\` to see the full diff
2. For each changed code file, also read the full file to understand context

3. **Trace the dependency chain** — this is critical:
   a. For every function/type/interface that was ADDED, CHANGED, or REMOVED:
      - Use Grep to find all callers and importers across the codebase
      - Read those caller files to check if the change breaks them
   b. For every changed function signature (params added/removed/retyped):
      - Verify ALL call sites pass the correct arguments
   c. For changed types/interfaces:
      - Check all files that import or implement them
   d. For changed API routes or response shapes:
      - Check frontend code that calls those endpoints
   e. For changed DB queries or schema:
      - Check all services that read/write those tables or columns

4. Check the changed code itself for:
   - Logic bugs, off-by-one errors, null/undefined handling
   - Missing error handling or uncaught exceptions
   - Security issues (injection, XSS, exposed secrets, path traversal)
   - Race conditions, deadlocks, or async/await issues
   - Type mismatches or wrong API contracts between frontend and backend
   - Broken imports or missing dependencies
   - Edge cases not handled

5. Output a structured review:

## Bug Review: ${COMMIT_INFO}

### Issues Found
(list each issue with severity: critical/warning/info, file, line, and description)

### Chain Reaction Risks
(issues in RELATED files — callers, importers, downstream consumers — that break due to these changes)

### Verdict
(CLEAN / NEEDS ATTENTION / HAS BUGS)

If no issues found, say the code looks clean and explain why you are confident.

Instructions:
1. Run \`${scoped_diff}\` to see the diff for ONLY these files

You are a senior code reviewer. Multiple batches of files from the same commit have been reviewed independently. Combine the results into a single coherent review.

Instructions:
1. Deduplicate any repeated issues
2. Look for cross-batch issues — a change in one batch that breaks something found in another batch
3. Produce the final combined review:

## Bug Review: ${COMMIT_INFO}

### Issues Found
(combined and deduplicated list with severity: critical/warning/info, file, line, description)

### Chain Reaction Risks
(cross-file and cross-batch risks)

### Verdict
(CLEAN / NEEDS ATTENTION / HAS BUGS — based on the worst severity found across all batches)

If no issues found across all batches, say the code looks clean.
